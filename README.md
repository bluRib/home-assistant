# IoT Home Lab

This repository documents my IoT-focused home lab setup. It is designed for testing, learning, and deploying smart home, networking, and sensor platforms using a robust virtualized environment.

## üß† Overview

My home lab leverages powerful mini PCs and open-source software to simulate a scalable, secure IoT environment. It includes LoRaWAN integration, smart home automation, monitoring, and network experimentation.

## üß∞ Hardware

- **Router**: UniFi Express Router
- **5G Gateway**: Inseego FX3100 (Ethernet-connected)
- **Compute**: 2x Beelink EQR5 Mini PCs  
  - AMD Ryzen 5 PRO 5650U (6 cores / 12 threads, 2.3‚Äì4.2GHz)
  - 32GB DDR4 RAM each
  - 500GB M.2 PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs
  - Dual Gigabit Ethernet, WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2
- **Virtualization**: Proxmox VE (acts as my Hyper-V replacement)
- **Storage**:  
  - 4-bay DAS connected to a **ZimaBoard** running **TrueNAS**
  - Zima also serves as quorum (third node) for Proxmox cluster

## üîê Networking & Access

- VLAN-separated networks
- DNS: Pi-hole
- VPN: Tailscale (remote access)
- Cloudflare Tunnel for secure web access

## üéØ Goals

- Run self-hosted services with high availability
- Monitor and automate home environment
- Explore LoRaWAN, Zigbee, and Bluetooth integrations
- Maintain full local control and security
